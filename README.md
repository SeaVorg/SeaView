This is SeaView
================

We are some highschoolers from Bulgaria who have an idea and spirit, and also we can code.
The webpage at which you can view the project is http://seaview.zapto.org/

About SeaView
===============================
![SeaView](http://i.imgur.com/mTW4Pg6.png)
SeaView is a real-time map illustrating sea currents and giving information from bouys to the web. The stations are getting their data dynamically from various places. In each station you can see the water levels, the temperature, wind data and more.These tsunami stations can warn people if danger is approaching via our web application. 

Since there probably wont be any real tsunami waves or the sea could be very calm at the moment you are viewing the site, we have set the needed level of the wave height to a lower number ( so if there are waves bigger than 20 ft you will see some indicators ). 

We are planning to do a few more upgrades which we were just short on time to achieve. 
Those include:
-Better clustering schema ( since there are too much stations we decided to cluster the overlapping ones, but didnt turn out very good )
-Some ocean colouring based on the temperature
-Better graphics for the currents  ( we used a script )
-Switch from 2d to 3d map - sphere model using webGL. We actually tried that first but we assumed its better to do something easier for our first hackathon :)

Although we are still in highschool, we have experience in programming and developing in many languages and platforms.
This is our first time at event like this, but we are ready and hopefully we can participate.

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. We will focus in using an API to gather data about different problematics we're (as humanity) facing in this moment. We're going to try to do so in a simpler manner, so everyone can read clearly what's going on.

We aim to build an utility that's going to be useful to millions of people every day, it could be used to warn from upcoming danger and even save people's lives.
